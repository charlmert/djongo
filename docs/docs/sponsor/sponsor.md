# Support

## Enterprise
If you are an enterprise that uses Djongo for commercial purposes, you need to buy a commercial license in order to use Djongo. 

You get access to the DjongoNxt source code, under commercial terms and conditions. To know more [send us a message](/support/#contact-us). 

Your organization gets a private [team discussion board][board] that is visible to only members of your organization. There is no limit to the number of members who have access.

## DjongoNxt
DjongoNxt brings support to more features of MongoDB. It is hosted as a private repository on Github. Issues raised here have a higher priority versus those raised on the public repository. 

Critical bug fixes and maintenance patches are first published to DjongoNxt.

## Priority Discussion Board
The priority [discussion board][board] is hosted on github and members with a subscription have access to it. Questions posted get a response within 24 hours.
